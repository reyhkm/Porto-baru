- **Component-Based Architecture**: Sections are broken down into reusable React components.
- **Elegant Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations powered by Framer Motion.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on all devices, from mobile to desktop.
- **Interactive AI Assistant**: A chat widget powered by a custom backend to answer questions about the portfolio owner.
- **Dynamic Content**: Project details are displayed in a clean, interactive modal.
- **Clean UI/UX**: A dark-themed, professional, and visually appealing interface.
